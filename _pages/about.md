I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Biomedical Informatics](https://biomedinfo.bjmu.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Dongyu Zhao](https://www.labxing.com/med.bio_zhao). My current research focuses on identifying and understanding cancer lncRNAs through the integration of multi-omics data and machine learning approaches. My research interest includes 3D genome structure change in cancer and Single-cell/spatial multi-omics data integration methods. \
In my free time, I enjoy badminton, hip-hop, and watching movies.
